# Twitter Scraping using SNScrape

Hello friends in this repository I make a code for scrapping the Twitter data using SNScrape and connected with NoSQL - MongoDB server

To install Snscrape we need to use developer package to get this code running

'Snscrape requires at least Python 3.8 or higher.'

First of all I created a 'function' python file and programmed the bacis function of scrapping and the option of uploading to MongoDB.

After creating that file I created a streamlit web application to make the code user friendly and to be accessible to even normal peoples.



This streamlit interface is used to retrieve tweet data with easy to use app interface...By using the different set options like search for user name or Tweet id  , starting date , ending date , maximum number of tweets, etc.... to scrape the data from Twitter according to their needs and upload it to our MongoDB database..

We can also save or download  the data in CSV/JSON format also ...

Enjoy coding :).....................
